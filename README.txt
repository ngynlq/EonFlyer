Final Project 

-EON FLYER

Intro/Score: This is a simple shootthemup bullet shooter game based mainly from the hell bullet shooter genre. This is to determine the basics of video game design process and learn how to develop a game. This game only features
only stage with a clear win or lose state, contains music and accepts
input from keyboard and gamepads with two joysticks at least 4 buttons

External Requirements: This game was created from python3.4 so python3.4
must be installed in order to run the game if you plan run from the
python scrips

setup and installation:
This game requires pygame to be installed in order to run

>python EonFlyer

Rules: Objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible and
defeat the boss at the end. You only have three lives and each collision
will result in a death. You can shoot enemies with the Z key and Bomb 
all bullets and heavily damage enemies on the screen. Your actual hitbox
is actually a tiny dot which you can only see when you press the left shift
button. This will also focus your attacks towards the center

Features:
*Mobs with different attack patterns
*Music
*High Score tracking
*A single boss
*Short tutorial explanining world and reasoning

Bugs
*The game does not do any form of error checking on the score.txt
so any edits could break the game.
*The game may be impossible to clear with a controller or with certain
controllers (From my experience
my controller would not reset to no input if I did not press anything)
*Does not handle errors gracefully so do not modify any of the files
